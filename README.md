# EscPos (NodeJS)

Library to manage EscPos commands in Buffer (NodeJS), then use an adapter to send the resulting data to the printer.

This Library is a refactoring/rewrite of another Node Escpos Library made by Lsong: [node-escpos](https://github.com/song940/node-escpos)

(Hopefully you will find some improvements)

Check the [printTest.js](https://github.com/risleylima/escpos/blob/main/examples/printTest.js) file on examples folder to get an ideia for how to use this library.

THIS README ISN`T READY YET.

Any support will be welcome!
